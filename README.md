# Robot-code-2025-primo

hello dear members. for sum of you this is going to be you're first code in first.
to save me and you some time here is a part docs about...

# how to write a good and orgenize code docs.
remember that you can always check the codes before, and the the PowerPoint presentation.
# structure  
TakeFeedSubsystem is just an example, this need to be adjusted to you're code.  
  1. class variable fields

  2. singelton

  3. constructor - this func needs to be private!!!

  4. runnable commands - do not forget java docs and comments.
  command docs - https://docs.wpilib.org/he/stable/docs/software/commandbased/commands.html
  i will add for each subsystem wich control system and profile (motion magic) you'll need to use.

  5. configs - at the moment just write at the end of the code a void func name config. 
  6. constance - this need to be written in constance.java and creat a class in there for you're subsystem.

# Conventions 
  statistically this is the number one reason for commits.

# SOLID 
  this part is a suggestion, i do think for you to understand why the code is like it is you must understand this.
